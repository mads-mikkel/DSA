 * 
 * This program illustrates how to perform measurements on an algorithm. Here we want to measure
 * how the .NET array sort algorithm performs. We start by arranging the necessary variables to 
 * perform the measurements. Then we generate random data. The measurement itself is a StopWatch
 * instance started as the last operation before the sort algorithm is called on the array instance,
 * and stopped immediately after. Then we present the results of the mesurements, individually and 
 * as an average. This average is used as the measurement of the performance of the algorithm, to
 * flatten out any inconsistent measurements. */
